# Bank to YNAB

This is a simple Python CLI tool for translating bank statements from various banks to the format that [YNAB](https://ynab.com) expects for imports.

Right now it only supports CSV inputs.

Pull requests are welcome, especially TOML configurations for other banks - I only indexed the ones that I use.
